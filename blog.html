          What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
        </h1>
        <article>
          localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no
          difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of
          sessionStorage. That is, the data stored in localStorage persists
          until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all
          current and future visits to the site. For sessionStorage, changes are
          only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the
          current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the
          stored data is deleted.

          What is the difference between global scope and block scope?
        </h1>
        <article>
          The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
          known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
          that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
          function or conditional state can access that variable. The block
          scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly
          brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
          statements, or something else. You can access global scope from
          anywhere in the given page, whilst the block scope can only be
          accessed within the block it has been defined.

        <article>
          An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and
          places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function
          stack becomes empty. The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript
          gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is
          single-threaded. The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript
          gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is
          single-threaded. The event queue is responsible for sending new
          functions to the stack for processing. The event loop facilitates this
          process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty.
          This entire process is called event loop.

        <h1 class="question-title">How do we get undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
        <article>
          Simply put, there are many ways we get undefined in JavaScript. When
          we don't define a variable, we get undefined. The key is in the word
          itself. When something is not defined, we get undefined. We can get
          undefined 8 different ways.

          <ul>
            <li>If a variable is not initialized.</li>
            <li>If nothing is returned from a function.</li>
            <li>
              If some parameters of a function are not called with values
              passed.
            </li>
            <li>If return value is not specified.</li>
            <li>
              Property that doesn't exist on an object will give me undefined.
            </li>
            <li>Accessing array elements outside the index range.</li>
            <li>Deletion of a value from a array by "delete".</li>
            <li>Set a value directly to undefined.</li>
          </ul>
