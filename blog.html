          What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
        </h1>
        <article>
          localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no
          difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of
          sessionStorage. That is, the data stored in localStorage persists
          until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all
          current and future visits to the site. For sessionStorage, changes are
          only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the
          current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the
          stored data is deleted.
